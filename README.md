# trainScheduler

project is working on the function of moment. This project challenges you to be able to use the current moment in different formats to be able to pull up the schedule for a particular train.

This page plays off the style and ease of the japanese bullet train and culture. The display is simple, easy and soft.

The whole page will update automatically with the setInterval function, which allows updated and updated current time and updated train arrival times.

each train is able to be removed from the top screen, so the display can always be edited for the user's preference.

firebase storage and removal is used to display the same train each time for the user once it is saved
